              <p class="card-text" id="blog-body">Travelers familiar with Singapore will already know the city's icon, the mythical Merlion with the body of a fish and the head of a lion.<br><br>
  
                One of his most famous depictions of this iconic symbol is the statue in Merlion Park, a Wan He Fullerton scenic spot near Singapore's central business district.<br><br>
                
                Before visiting this beautiful place, you may want to learn more about the symbolism behind the Merlion and its interdependence with our country's history.
                That the Merlion is part lion and part fish is a story deeper than skin (or stone).
                The Merlion's fish-like body symbolizes Singapore's origins as a fishing village. Temasek is derived from the same root as the word Tasek (“Lake” in Malay). The head of the statue represents the original name of the city of Singapore (Lion City in Sanskrit). According to legend, San Nira Utama (Prince of Srivijayan from Palembang) landed on our shores in the midst of a sea storm.<br><br>
                
                Near the mouth of the Singapore River, the Prince discovered a strange creature, identified it as a lion, and gave Singapore its name.</p>

              <p class="card-text" id="blog-body">Petronas Towers is a pair of iconic skyscrapers located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Completed in 1998, they were the tallest buildings in the world at that time, surpassing the previous record held by the Sears Tower in Chicago.<br><br>

                Designed by Argentine-American architect Cesar Pelli, the Petronas Towers are a symbol of Malaysia's rapid modernization and economic growth. The towers are 88 stories tall and stand at a height of 1,483 feet (452 meters), with a distinctive postmodern style featuring Islamic motifs.<br><br>
                
                The towers are home to the headquarters of the national oil company of Malaysia, Petronas, and many other companies. They also house a shopping mall, a concert hall, and an observation deck on the 86th floor that offers a stunning panoramic view of the city.<br><br>
                
                The construction of the towers was a significant feat of engineering, with a unique tube-in-tube structural design that makes them exceptionally strong and able to withstand strong winds and earthquakes. The towers are connected by a skybridge on the 41st and 42nd floors, which provides a means of escape in case of emergencies.<br><br>
                
                Today, the Petronas Towers remain a beloved symbol of Malaysia and a popular tourist attraction, attracting millions of visitors each year. They have also become an important cultural landmark and have been featured in numerous movies, TV shows, and advertisements around the world.</p>

              <p class="card-text" id="blog-body">Venice, Italy is a city that has captured the hearts of millions of people around the world for centuries. Known as the “City of Water” or “Floating City,” Venice is built on more than 100 small islands in the Venetian Lagoon. This romantic and picturesque city is famous for its canals, gondolas, bridges, architecture, and art, making it a top tourist destination in Italy and Europe.<br><br>

                Venice's history dates back to the 5th century, when the Veneti people settled on the islands to escape the invading barbarians. Over time, Venice became an important maritime power and commercial center, trading with the Byzantine Empire, the Middle East, and Europe. Venice's wealth and power are reflected in its stunning architecture, which features Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque styles, as well as its art, which includes works by famous painters such as Titian, Tintoretto, and Canaletto.<br><br>
                
                One of the most iconic features of Venice is its canals, which are used as the city's main transportation network. Visitors can take a romantic gondola ride along the canals to see the city from a unique perspective, passing under the famous Rialto Bridge and admiring the elegant palaces and churches that line the waterways. Alternatively, visitors can take a vaporetto, or water bus, to explore the different neighborhoods of Venice, including the famous St. Mark's Square.<br><br>
                
                St. Mark's Square is the heart of Venice, featuring the beautiful St. Mark's Basilica, Doge's Palace, and the Campanile bell tower. Visitors can climb to the top of the Campanile to enjoy stunning views of the city and the lagoon. The Doge's Palace, which served as the residence of the Doge of Venice and the seat of government, is a masterpiece of Gothic architecture and features exquisite works of art, including paintings by Veronese and Tintoretto.</p>

              <p class="card-text" id="blog-body">Niagara Falls is a breathtaking natural wonder located on the Niagara River, which serves as the border between the United States and Canada. The falls consist of three separate waterfalls, the American Falls, the Bridal Veil Falls, and the Horseshoe Falls, which collectively form the largest waterfall system in the world in terms of volume.<br><br>

                The Horseshoe Falls, which are located on the Canadian side, are the most well-known and popular of the three waterfalls, attracting millions of visitors each year. The falls are 167 feet (51 meters) high and span 2,600 feet (792 meters) across, creating a powerful roar and a misty spray that can be seen and felt from miles away.<br><br>
                
                The history of Niagara Falls dates back over 12,000 years, when it was formed during the last ice age. The falls have since played an important role in the development of the surrounding area, serving as a source of hydroelectric power and a major tourist destination.<br><br>
                
                Visitors to Niagara Falls can enjoy a wide range of activities, including boat tours, hiking trails, and scenic overlooks. The area is also home to many restaurants, hotels, and casinos, making it a popular destination for both families and couples.<br><br>
                
                Despite its popularity, Niagara Falls remains a natural wonder that is protected by strict conservation laws. Efforts are constantly being made to preserve and protect the falls and the surrounding ecosystem, ensuring that future generations will be able to enjoy this incredible natural wonder for years to come.</p>

              <p class="card-text" id="blog-body">The Eiffel Tower is an iconic symbol of Paris, France and one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. Named after its designer, Gustave Eiffel, the tower was built in 1889 as the entrance arch to the World's Fair and has since become one of the most visited attractions in Paris.<br><br>

                The tower stands at 1,063 feet (324 meters) tall, including its antenna, and was the tallest man-made structure in the world at the time of its construction. It consists of four massive lattice steel columns that come together to form a single central pylon, with two observation decks at different heights that offer stunning views of the city.<br><br>
                
                The Eiffel Tower has a rich history and has played an important role in France's cultural heritage. It was initially criticized by some as an eyesore, but over time it has become a beloved symbol of Paris and French engineering prowess.<br><br>
